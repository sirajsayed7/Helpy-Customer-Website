# Helpy customer website — agent handoff

Last updated: 27 September 2026.

## Goal and current boundary

The desktop website is being migrated from demonstration records to contracts observed in the Helpy Android APK. Discovery, businesses, business services, availability, email OTP authentication, profile reads/edits, notifications, bookings, wallet reads, favourites reads and addresses use a shared live data layer.

The booking workflow intentionally stops at final review. Do not call `/add-booking`, create a payment, or display success until staging and payment sandbox contracts are supplied.

## Run and verify

```powershell
npm install
Copy-Item .env.example .env
# The backend is always enabled; optionally override VITE_HELPY_API_BASE in .env
npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run build
```

Desktop entry: `http://127.0.0.1:4173/?desktop=1#home`.

`.env` is ignored. Never commit bearer tokens, OTP values, Firebase ID/custom tokens, merchant credentials, service-account JSON, or private keys.

## Important files

- `src/api/helpy.ts`: API client, session separation, encodings and route wrappers.
- `src/api/auth.ts`: email OTP adapter.
- `src/api/chat.ts`: Firebase custom-token exchange and Firestore adapter.
- `src/context/HelpyDataContext.tsx`: catalog/account loading and response mapping.
- `src/desktop/DesktopLiveViews.tsx`: business discovery/profile, availability, checkout review, bookings and chat.
- `src/desktop/DesktopAccountViews.tsx`: original profile and notification designs adapted to backend data.
- `src/desktop/DesktopWebsite.tsx`: desktop routing and global header.
- `BACKEND_INTEGRATION_AUDIT.md`: runtime-verified conventions and coverage.
- `APK_ENDPOINT_INVENTORY.md`: full route inventory and status.
- `CHAT_BACKEND_CONTRACT.md`: secure server requirement for messaging.

## Active architecture

`App.tsx` wraps navigation with `HelpyDataProvider`. Desktop widths render `DesktopWebsite`. Catalog reads use a guest token; private reads require a session explicitly tagged `user`, preventing a guest token from appearing logged in.

Catalog loading:

1. Guest bootstrap.
2. Categories.
3. Featured services, top providers and one service page per category.
4. Group services by nested `created_by.id` into businesses.
5. Search/category views show businesses; business profiles own service lists.
6. Service/date selection requests `/vendor-availability`.

After OTP login, profile, addresses, booking statuses 0/1/2, favourites, wallet history and notifications load in parallel.

## Backend-driven desktop flows

- Home: backend categories and grouped businesses; approved four local banners remain by design.
- Browse: business-first search and category filtering.
- Business profile: business identity, services, prices and live slots.
- Checkout: service, date, slot, authenticated address and notes; submit disabled.
- Profile: designed banner/cards/form using profile, wallet, booking, favourite and notification data.
- Notifications: designed list using backend title/body/time/read state and contextual routing.
- Bookings: backend status lists and detail refresh.
- Messages: two-pane design with Firestore adapter; secure token endpoint required.

## Contract caveats

- Profile/address/notification mutations and booking detail need staging verification.
- The analysis account had no bookings, addresses or favourites; populated variants remain unverified.
- Catalog requests page 1, limit 100 for every category. Add pagination/consolidation.
- `lan` and `long` default to Doha. Connect browser/selected-location coordinates.
- Business profiles are grouped from creator records; consider refreshing vendor detail/offerings on open.
- Mobile-width React pages still contain older local datasets.
- Legacy placeholder components remain in source but are inactive in desktop routing.

## Messaging continuation

Never copy the APK's exposed Firebase Admin key into Vite code. Build the endpoint in `CHAT_BACKEND_CONTRACT.md`, rotate the compromised key, configure `VITE_HELPY_CHAT_TOKEN_ENDPOINT`, and test Firestore rules with two staging users. The browser adapter then loads users, polls messages and sends APK-compatible text messages.

## Recommended next work

1. Obtain backend source/OpenAPI and a staging account.
2. Implement the secure chat-token endpoint.
3. Capture populated booking/address/favourite/notification responses and tighten mappings.
4. Connect global search, pagination and authoritative business detail loading.
5. Add favourite toggle, review creation, unseen badges and logout.
6. Implement cancellation/rescheduling in staging.
7. Integrate booking creation and SkipCash sandbox with idempotency/webhooks.
8. Move mobile-width pages onto the shared live data layer.

## Safety constraints

- Do not probe state-changing production routes to discover schemas.
- Do not create real bookings, charges, payouts, addresses or profile changes without explicit authorization.
- Never expose Firebase Admin, SkipCash merchant or other server credentials to the browser bundle.
- Treat the embedded APK service-account key as compromised even if it still works.
